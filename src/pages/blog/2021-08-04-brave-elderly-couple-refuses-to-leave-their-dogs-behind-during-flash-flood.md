When natural calamities like a flood happen, everything is destroyed in seconds, just like that. We don’t get enough time to decide what we want to take with us and what we want to leave. 

But even in that chaos, a brave elderly couple decided to save their dog. They refused to leave their good boy behind in the flash flood and waited for help. 

## This was what happened to the residents of a town in Japan. These residents had to escape right when a flash flood hit.
